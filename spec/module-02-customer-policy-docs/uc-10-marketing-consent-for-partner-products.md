# Module 2 · Customer Policy — UC 10 · Marketing consent for partner products (CANDIDATE)

> AI implementation brief, generated from the v5 spec (`spec/.../use-cases/`). Source of truth is the spec; regenerate, don't hand-edit.

## Context

- Module: 2 · Customer Policy · category Rule · domain `policy` · command `check-policy` · outcomes: APPROVED, REFERRED, REJECTED
- Use case: 10 · Marketing consent for partner products · track C · prerequisite: after 01–08 · build shape: config field + engine branch · primary screen: Decision Detail (rule 6)
- Data effect: config list + engine branch
- Platform rules (non-negotiable): the orchestrator is the only caller; the whole application arrives in the envelope (plus the v5 `outputs` block, Option A); steps are independent and re-orderable; the payload is NEVER stored — only `applicationId`; every module ships `GET /cases/{id}/applicant` proxying the orchestrator; big lists are empty by default and capped at 10 rows (≤10 hydration calls); ALL APIs are idempotent — same request twice, same result once; every endpoint appears in the service's OpenAPI 3.0 (Swagger) spec.

## Story

The bank plans a co-branded partner card — an airline rewards product where earning miles means sharing transaction data with the partner. Without the applicant's marketing/data-sharing consent the product literally cannot function, so policy must catch it before onboarding, not after. Ordinary own-brand products are untouched: consent stays optional there, as the law expects.

## What it adds

- PolicyConfig gains `partnerProducts` (string[] of productCodes, nullable — empty means no partner products).
- The engine gains rule 6: product.productCode in partnerProducts AND consents.marketingConsent false → REJECTED; ruleResults gains a 6th section when the list is non-empty.
- New reason code `POL_PARTNER_CONSENT_MISSING` — a v5 contract addition, instructor applies it.
- First engine branch that reads product.productCode and consents.marketingConsent — the Payload fields table gains two ● marks.

## Acceptance criteria

1. With CREDIT_CARD_REWARDS configured as a partner product, an application for it with marketingConsent false → REJECTED with POL_PARTNER_CONSENT_MISSING, field consents.marketingConsent.
2. The same application with marketingConsent true passes rule 6.
3. Applications for non-partner products are unaffected by their consent value — all eight UC 01–08 ACs still pass unchanged.
4. The partner list is versioned config: adding or removing a product is a new PolicyConfig version, no deploy, old cases pinned.
5. The Decision Detail screen renders the extra rule card only when the decision includes it.

### Entity model (suggested — the shape to beat)

![Entity model](diagrams/er-suggested.jpg)

**PolicyRecord — one row per applicationId (unique)**

| field | type | key | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| applicationId | string | PK | the journey key from the envelope — one row per application, and the ONLY applicant-related column |
| outcome | enum |  | the final answer: APPROVED, REFERRED or REJECTED — starts equal to machineOutcome; only a human decision changes it |
| machineOutcome | enum |  | what rules 1–3 computed before sampling — shown to the reviewer, never changed |
| reference | string |  | human-facing case reference shown on every screen, e.g. pol-000187 |
| policyConfigVersion | int | FK | the PolicyConfig version that decided this case — pinned forever, never re-pointed |
| ruleResults | JSON |  | embedded results of the four checks — existingProduct (with registryChecked), taxResidency (with matchedList), restrictionList, sampling (sampled + position) |
| claimedBy | string, nullable |  | referral queue — the operator who claimed the case |
| claimedAt | timestamp, nullable |  | referral queue — when it was claimed |
| decidedBy | string, nullable |  | who made the human decision (queue or override) — null means the machine's answer stands |
| decidedAt | timestamp, nullable |  | when the human decision was made |
| decisionReason | string, nullable |  | the mandatory reason recorded with every human decision |
| submittedAt | timestamp |  | when the orchestrator submitted the case |

**PolicyConfig — insert-only, versioned lists; the current version is the highest**

| field | type | key | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| version | int | PK | one new row per change — rows are inserted, never updated |
| supportedResidencies | string[] |  | rule 2 — at least one tax residency must be on this list, else REJECTED (seeded GB, IE, PL, DE, FR, ES, NL) |
| excludedResidencies | string[] |  | rule 2 — any residency on this list REJECTS, even beside a supported one (seeded US) |
| restrictionList | JSON |  | rule 3 — the bank's own blocked people as {fullName, dateOfBirth, reason} entries (seeded Victor Sable and Dana Kovacs) |
| sampleEvery | int |  | rule 4's X — every Xth first-time decision is REFERRED for human review (seeded 7) |
| effectiveFrom | timestamp |  | when this version became the current one |

**OverrideLog — audit trail; one row per manual override, none ever deleted**

| field | type | key | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| applicationId | string | FK | the case that was overridden |
| oldOutcome | enum |  | the outcome before the override |
| newOutcome | enum |  | the outcome after the override |
| reason | string |  | the mandatory justification typed by the operator |
| operator | string |  | who performed the override |
| overriddenAt | timestamp |  | when it happened |

Relationships: PolicyRecord N:1 PolicyConfig — each decision pins the version it used · PolicyRecord 1:N OverrideLog — every override is audited to its case

## Why this one

A different lesson from UC 09: this is the first policy rule keyed on WHICH product is requested, not on who the applicant is — it forces the team to argue about where product policy ends and customer policy begins, with one config list and one engine branch as the whole cost. The other candidate ideas for module 2 stay unadopted in v5.
